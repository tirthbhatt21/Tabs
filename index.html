                <p>Bhagwan Swaminarayan manifested in northern India in 1781 CE to grant eternal liberation to countless souls, remove misguided religious practices,, and dispel misinterpretations that had crept into Hinduism.</p>
                <p>Heading a socio-spiritual awakening, he established the Swaminarayan Sampradaya at the age of 20, introducing social reforms, serving the poor and needy, and preaching against superstitions, addictions and violence.

                    During his lifetime, he initiated around 3,000 sadhus (ordained monks), and was recognised and worshipped as Purushottam (supreme God) by countless individuals.
                    
                    To continue his work of moral and spiritual regeneration, he promised to remain ever-present on earth through an unbroken succession of enlightened, God-realised gurus.</p>
