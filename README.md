                <img src="img/bhagwan-swami-img.png" width="150px">
                <p>Bhagwan Swaminarayan manifested in northern India in 1781 CE to grant eternal liberation to countless souls, remove misguided religious practices,, and dispel misinterpretations that had crept into Hinduism.</p>
                <p>Heading a socio-spiritual awakening, he established the Swaminarayan Sampradaya at the age of 20, introducing social reforms, serving the poor and needy, and preaching against superstitions, addictions and violence.

                    During his lifetime, he initiated around 3,000 sadhus (ordained monks), and was recognised and worshipped as Purushottam (supreme God) by countless individuals.
                    
                    To continue his work of moral and spiritual regeneration, he promised to remain ever-present on earth through an unbroken succession of enlightened, God-realised gurus.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Gunatitanand Swami (1784-1867 CE)</h2>
                <hr>
                <img src="img/aksharbrahma-img.png" width="150px">
                <p>Gunatitanand Swami was the first spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan.

                    <p>He lived a life of an ideal sadhu, dedicated to the devotion of God, service of others, and sharing of profound wisdom. His insightful discourses have been recorded as the ‘Swamini Vato’ scripture, which is read daily by thousands of devotees around the world.
                    He was revealed by Bhagwan Swaminarayan to be Akshar, the perfectly enlightened devotee and the closest entity to Purushottam (God) as extolled in the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita.</p>

                    <p>This naturally made him the perfect exponent of Bhagwan Swaminarayan’s supreme divine identity and spiritual philosophy.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the embodiment of Akshar, Gunatitanand Swami remains manifest on earth as the enlightened guru, helping aspirants attain God-realisation.</p>

                <p>Bhagatji Maharaj was the second spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan.</p>

                <p>His intense desire to worship God endeared him to many.</p>
                    
                <p>He worked tirelessly and joyously to serve others despite being shunned and insulted by the ignorant.</p>
                <p>He lived a life of unflinching faith and endeavoured resolutely according to the wishes of his guru Gunatitanand Swami, making him a shining inspiration for all seekers of spiritual enlightenment.</p>

                <p>His saintly virtues and spiritual realisation singled him out as successor to Gunatitanand Swami despite not being a sadhu (ordained monk).</p>

                <h2>Shastriji Maharaj (1865-1951 CE)</h2>

                <p>He overcame insurmountable challenges to build five grand mandirs, consecrating within them the images of Gunatitanand Swami (Akshar) and Bhagwan Swaminarayan (Purushottam).</p>
                    
                <p>In 1907, he formally established BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS).</p>
